# Contributing File:
  This is an agreement between the contributors:
    1. We will only make a pull request when it is a stable branch, and has robust testing.
    2. No group member may merge their own pull request on GitHub (other group members must merge it, after reviewing it.)
    3. We agree to use AirBnB Ruby style conventions.
